    So many satisfying linkages in the world! I spent a while looking at Daniel Piker's (creator of Kangaroo) 
    creations (<a href="https://twitter.com/KangarooPhysics">link</a>), as well as Twitter user Keishiro Ueki's linkages
    (<a href="https://twitter.com/KeishiroUeki/status/1446799149777645573">link</a>), and this repository
    of paper mechanisms from Kelli Anderson & Robby Kraft (<a href="http://cutfoldtemplates.com/">link</a>).
    Interested in these paper mechanisms and FoldMecha's craft linkages, I decided to use cardboard as my mechanism
    material. And while I was inspired by the many varieties of linkages in the world, I begin with a humble scissor
    linkage, since its motion is satisfyingly expressive to me.
    <br><br>
    I found and printed these <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3687946/files">cardboard rivets</a>
    on Thingiverse to test. I found that a slightly scaled down size worked well.

    <h3 id="mech">scissor mechanism</h3>
    Before making a physical mechanism, I simulated one in Grasshopper using Kangaroo to test varying links of 
    varying lengths. I settled on links 100mm long and 25mm wide; the simulation would be particularly helpful
    if I wanted to combine mechanisms together to produce more complicated motion.

    I laser cut cardboard links with 3 4mm holes for the cardboard rivets:

      <span class="post-meta center">links!</span>
    </div>
    <br><br>
    Then I assembled the linkage! Very fun to pop the rivets in and play with the resulting mechanism.

    <h3 id="sense">sensing state</h3>
    Aligned with FoldMecha's findings about crafts extensibility, my original idea to sense state was to use
    conductive fabric in a voltage divider, and calibrate it such that stretching the fabric would move anchor
    points in Rhino. The values weren't nearly consistent enough to do this though, at least with my very lo-fi
    prototype.
    <br><br>
    <div class="center">
      <img class="fig_img" src="./images/stretch.png"><br/>
      <span class="post-meta center">conductive fabric taped to handle</span>
    </div>
    <br><br>
    Then I played around with mounting one linkage to a servo to be able to set its position,
    but the little servo I had at home wasn't powerful enough. In the end, I returned to the conductive
    fabric to make a button to sense a closed state. When closed, the Kangaroo Solver component's reset input
    is triggered, closing the virtual mechanism.

    <h3 id="reflection">reflections</h3>
    I'm happy to get some exposure to Kangaroo to use in future projects. In particular, it'd be fun
    to <i>send</i> data to microcontroller to control a project based on a Grasshopper simulation; I'm imagining
    silly little linkage plotters. The appeal to 'craft' through conductive fabric is a bit half-hearted here; I think 
    that combining the expressivity of mechanism motion with e.g. the creative spirit of 
    Kobakant would make for some engaging artifacts!
