    Got a late start to my daily practice today, so it's somewhat abbreviated. In planning a turntable for phenakistoscopes,
    I'm realizing that this is similar to Tiffany Tseng's <a href="http://spin.media.mit.edu/">Spin</a>/Build In Progress projects
    for process-oriented documentation. I think I can draw from her designs here, with some tweaks to the electronics to use
    what we already have in lab.

    I've started recreating my board from <a href="https://bsubbaraman.github.io/MakingIt/assignments/a8/a8.html">Making It</a> class in SVG-PCB. A main change I'd 
    like to make is using some smaller package--like an H-Bridge--to drive the stepper motor rather than another breakout board; I'm hoping this
    will clean the board up a bit, and be something a bit different. 

    <h3>reflections & notes</h3>
    Half the work of electronics is remembering the name of all the footprints/etc that I'm using. I actually think SVG-PCB might make the repurposing
    of old designs much quicker, because the overhead of opening KiCad is significant for me right now.
