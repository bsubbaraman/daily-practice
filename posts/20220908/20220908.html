    The artist <a href="https://www.traceloops.com/">traceloops</a> makes cool stop motion animations,
    which are kind of like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenakistiscope">phenakistiscopes</a>.
    Since I like making <a href="https://blairsubbaraman.com/Sketches-1">looping gifs</a> anyways, this 
    seems like a cool place to start!

    I want to set up a workflow which creates svg's in p5 which are ready to laser cut on the
    Machine Agency's Trotec Speedy 400, along with guides for photgraphing and assembling.

    <h3> p5 sketch </h3>
    This <a href="../20220908/code/sketch.js">p5 sketch</a> uses the p5 svg library to directly create
    svgs. A circle with a diameter of 10 in p5 land creates a circle of radius ~3mm in the real world,
    so I'm manually applying a scale factor to work with real-world units. There's probably some 
    smarter way to handle this... but works for now. The speedy 400 wants a stroke width of 
    0.001mm, but that's impossible to see on the digital canvas. I made a quick spiral to test out, adding a
    circle in the center as the mounting point for subsequent pictures.

    <h3> laser cutting </h3>
    Super easy to laser cut, the svg is in a format ready for the speedy. Maybe some ~direct control~ is 
    to come...

    <h3> photographing </h3>
    I took pictures on the Jubilee since it had a camera tool equipped alreaady. I taped a sheet of 
    paper to the bed plate, made sure the entire sheet was in view-ish, and marked the paper through 
    the phenakistiscope mounting hole with a sharpie. I eyeballed 8 points to rotate around-- I should
    add these guidelines in the p5 sketch to make this more precise.

    For posterity: assemble the photos into a gif with 
    <code>convert -delay 15 -loop 0 *.png phenakistoscsope.gif</code>
    (requires imagemagick)

    <h3>reflections & notes</h3>
    Compared to making purely digital loops, there's definitely some delayed gratification in making
    physical loops. But, it's a ton of fun to see the p5 sketch come to life on the laser cutter. 
    Next time, I can (a) make the phenakistiscope a bit smaller, (b) laser cut a circle around it, and (c) add
    rotation guides to make this whole thing cleaner. A different photography setup with better lighting
    will help, too. Can also simulate the loop in p5 to play around with how many frames to include.
