    <h3>reflections & notes</h3>

    Got my covid booster today so was out of the lab early-- instead, I did some poking around on other related
    projects that can serve as future daily practice inspo. Nervous System's <a href="https://n-e-r-v-o-u-s.com/projects/sets/zoetropes/">
    3D printed zoetropes</a> are cool. They work particularly well in the context of growth algorithms, but 
    Nadya had suggested adding some electronics to view my phenakistoscopes live; and, zoetropes might play
    well with some p5.fab printing adventures, too. I think next week I'll focus on making a turntable, 
    which is the first step towards both of these ideas.
