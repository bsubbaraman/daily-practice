    <h3 id="first-steps"> first steps </h3>
    Despite saying that I wanted to be a shoe designer when I grow up in a 3rd grade school project,
    I have next to no idea how shoes are made. Following the hybrid fabrication workflows of DuoSkin 
    & ExoSkin from this week's papers, I started by 
    <a href="https://www.instructables.com/craft/howto/shoe/">reading a bit</a> about
    'analog' shoe making processes. I learned the process normally starts from a model of your foot (a <i>last</i>),
    which you can draw your pattern on, then remove to transfer the pattern onto the material of your choice.
    In the sprit of these hybrid fabrication processes,
    I decided to use this cut and sew method of shoe making combined with some digital 
    fabrication technology. For the design, I went with a pair of slippers/flats; it seemed like a simple pattern & geometry
    to start from. I just sketched an outline of this design on paper. By doing so,
    I made these shoes specific to me.
    
    <br/><br/>
    <div class="center">
      <img class="fig_img" src="./images/cardboard.png"><br/>
      <span class="post-meta">upper pattern for of my slipper/shoe/thing</span>
    </div>
    <br/><br/>

    <h3 id="fabric">making the "fabric"</h3>

    I've liked the look of <a href="https://www.nike.com/flyknit">Nike Flyknit shoes</a>,
    where the designers use strands of yarn in different knit patterns to make some parts more sturdy, or 
    breathable, etc. This customization based on foot data is reminiscent of the mechanical metamaterial structures
    for shoe soles discussed in class. I don't have the time (or data) to make anything so functional,
    but I want to use this as an aesthetic inspiration. 
    To achieve a flexible, wireframe-y looking ""fabric"" to make my shoe out of, I tried 3D printing sheets of single
    width extrusions. I did this using my p5.fab library. Here's a little test swatch of single layer height:

    <br/><br/>
    <div class="center">
      <img class="fig_img" src="./images/test.jpg"><br/>
      <span class="post-meta">bendy</span>
    </div>
    <br/><br/>

    Though I tried single, double, and triple layer heights, I found that a single layer height
    was durable enough for these purposes and decreased fabrication time. From here I made two aesthetic-driven
    choices: in analogy to the functional tight/loose knits in Flyknits, I varied the spacing between extrusions.
    This was also a somewhat strategic decision to decrease print time:

    <br/><br/>
    <div class="gallery">
      <img class="fig_img" src="./images/base.png">
      <img class="fig_img" src="./images/spacing.png">
      <span class="post-meta center"> toolpath viz and associated print using varied spacing.
      the edges curl quite a bit; i just treat the edges as sacrificial.
      </span>
    </div>
    <br/><br/>

    And for a bit of "colorwork", I swapped filaments to white and printed the same pattern again offset a bit. 
    The result:
    <br/><br/>
    <div class="center">
      <img class="fig_img" src="./images/color.png"><br/>
      <span class="post-meta">another color</span>
    </div>
    <br/><br/>

    <!-- <pre>
      <code>
        code block
      </code>
    </pre> -->


    So, I was able to make sheets of my material by printing one in one filament, swapping & flushing 
    the old color, and printing in the second. Each filament color prints in about 15 minutes, so I'm able to
    make a 175mmx175mm sheet of 'fabric' in just over a half hour. Unfortunately my foot is larger
    than the Ender print bed, so I needed two sheets per shoe upper --> 4 sheets total.
    
    <h3 id="assembly">assembly</h3>
    I made the (perhaps unwise) decision to take this homework assignment
    as an opportunity to learn how to sew. The shoe general assembly process was to:
    <ul>
      <li>cut the material based on my shoe pattern above; to do this, I just taped the sheets together. (I 
        couldn't start by sewing them, otherwise I'd cut right through what I'd sewn). </li>
      <br/><br/>
      <div class="center">
        <img class="fig_img" src="./images/cut.png"><br/>
      </div>
      <br/><br/>
      <li>sew the two sheets together</li>
      <br/><br/>
      <div class="center">
        <img class="fig_img" src="./images/sew-sheets.png"><br/>
      </div>
      <br/><br/>
      <li>sew the sheets to the sole material. I had originally planned to sew directly onto an 
        old shoe insert that I had; however, I found the material ended up being too difficult. In a 
        Project Runway Unconventional Material Challenge Moment™, I instead used the packaging
        from some Protopasta filament, mostly for the silver color. This is not a great sole material choice.
      </li> 
      <br/><br/>
      <div class="center">
        <img class="fig_img" src="./images/sole-sew.png"><br/>
      </div>
      <br/><br/>
    </ul>

    The result is something that <i>kinda</i> looks like a shoe, in form if not function:
    <br><br>
    <div class="gallery">
      <img class="fig_img" src="./images/shoe-1.png">
      <img class="fig_img" src="./images/shoe-2.png">
      <img class="fig_img" src="./images/shoe-3.png">
      <span class="post-meta center"> "what are thoooooooose"
      </span>
    </div>
    <br><br>

    The final products are wildly different sizes and borderline unwearable,
    but here they are on the foot! I ended up inserting the shoe inserts that 
    I was going to sew into.

    <br/><br/>
      <div class="center">
        <img class="fig_img" src="./images/wear.png"><br/>
        <span class="post-meta center"> 'designing for frustration', or something
        </span>
      </div>
      <br/><br/>

    <h3 id="reflection">reflections</h3>
    Sewing skills aside, I thought that printing over the pattern in two colors opened
    up some interesting possibilities for printing with the p5.fab system. Color is such 
    an important part of the visual design process with p5.js, and I'd like to capture
    a bit of that. It'd be fun to get it running on a dual-extruder setup.
    <br><br>
    In terms of process: printing sheets significantly sped up fabrication time relative to printing e.g. a 
    complete shoe, but the material wasn't terribly conducive to sewing. A tighter pattern might have made it
    a bit easier (though that would also increase print time). I thought of the sheets as raw fabric to
    cut up after the fact; a better idea might be to print the final pattern directly 
    so that we don't print excess material (e.g. the shoe hole), and would make 
    the shape & size more easily replicable.

    <h3>DuoSkin</h3>
    In Duoskin, the authors explore the use of gold leaf to fabricate 
    low-cost epidermal electronics otherwise constrained to the medical industry. 
    They present their rapid prototyping process which primarily relies on gold leaf as a 
    conductor for different I/O modalities, demonstrate its use through functional devices, 
    technical evaluation for durability/robustness, and a workshop which allows people to 
    customize their electronics. They suggest on-skin devices to be a medium for expressivity 
    and argue for aesthetic control of the user. Last line is possibly interesting in relation to Beating the Meat paper.

    <h3>ExoSkin</h3>
    In Exoskin, the authors explore hybrid fabrication workflows 
    (i.e. using both analog and digital methods) for on-body printing. 
    To do so, they contribute a set of design considerations for on-body printing 
    (material choice, machine configs, content, and workflows) and the present their 
    system exoskin which is a proof-of-concept system which permits design & fabrication on-body. 
    The find that this system is technically feasible and relevant for domain specific applications.

    <h3>Exploring mechanical meta-material structures through personalised shoe sole design</h3>
    In this paper, the authors explore combinations of metamaterial structures to design shoe soles. 
    To do so, they analyze foot/gait data and map the results to different MMS with relevant behavior. 
    They fabricate a shoe sole and comment on the process. 
    The most notable finding is that there are limited availability 
    for software tools which enable exploration of metamaterials. 
    The outline what such software tools should enable to permit efficient exploration of MMS in practice.

    <h3>Prosthetic Imagination</h3>
    This paper takes an in-depth look at the ramifications of technology as ‘prosthesis’. T
    he author begins by critiquing various existing theories regarding prosthesis, 
    teasing out cultural factors from an otherwise medically-based trope. These include 
    repetitive labor in the Ford factory, financial compensation based on gender & sexuality,
     and misguided laws of averages invoked for e.g. airbag safety guidelines. They go 
     on to turn prosthesis as supplementing an existing deficiency on its head, instead 
     suggesting that prosthesis provides the deficiency by providing normative values of wholeness. 
     They bring this into the economic-discursive realm through a discussion of consumerism & ‘freedom’. 
     They conclude with limitations of prosthesis as an analytical tool, arguing that identity differences 
     & their material consequences are ‘incomprehensible’ through a lens of prosthetics.

     <h3>Beating the Meat</h3>
     This paper examines the tension between body & machine, in large part through 
     first-person experience with leg amputation.
