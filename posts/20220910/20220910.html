    Away from machines on the weekend, so I focused on Digital Stuff. I added little simulations 
    of the animation, and generated a <a href="./code/hexagons/index.html">couple</a> new
    <a href="code/shape-morph/index.html">designs</a> to make during the week.

    <h3>reflections & notes</h3>
    Adding the simulation was a suprisingly big help. It was much quicker to tweak small things, like
    how quickly I should rotate the shapes. Since I'm not sending machine instructions directly (yet),
    I found myself dreading the software overhead that the last iterations have required: uploading
    the svg to GDrive, opening it on the computer connected to the laser cutter's, open the svg
    in illustrator, press print, open the JobControl software which the laser cutter uses; all to
    cut my file in less than 30 seconds. And only then can I start taking photos.
