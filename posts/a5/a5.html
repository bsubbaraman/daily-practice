    This week, we were given files to mill on the Othermill! First we test milled an ATtiny board from Nadya.
    We'll build on this to modify more complex PCBs next week.

    <br>

    The Bantam tools software is a little bit funny to use, but generally straightforward. Some general reminders for 
    my long-term memory:
    <ul>
      <li> NPTH drill files don't work on machine for some reason, so manually set the file if the software auto-fills</li>
      <li> Default trace depth is 0.15mm, that's reasonable. Default trace clearance is also 0.15 mm, can up that to make it easier to solder at first </li>
      <li> Be sure to add a sacrificial layer below your material</li>
      <li> Measure the material in various places with calipers to set both material offset and material settings </li>
      <li> Can add a large z plan offset to test mill in the air and make sure everything looks good</li>
    </ul>

    My board turned out okay!

    Two notes: first, the holes are about a centimeter off. I had set the x & y plan offset to be 10 mm for each cut, so I <i>think</i>
    that when I milled the traces, the plan offset didn't propogate through in y. Doing this again, it's very important to actually check the 
    preview to make sure things look reasonable!

    Second, Nadya noted that there are a few small copper fingers left in my traces, which will cause shorts/bad connections
    when we populate the board. To get rid of these, we can run it under water and visually confirm everything looks good.

    As a final small success, we made a simple LED circuit in KiCad during class, which I then milled and soldered. It worked- hooray!

    While designing in Kicad and surface mount soldering will both take a good amount of time, I'm actually
    quite surprised at how approachable the actual milling process was! I've been more or less stuck to the breadboard
    for my electronics career thus far, so I'm really excited to be able to mill PCBs now.
