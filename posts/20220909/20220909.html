    Following <a href="../20220908/20220908.html">yesterday's</a> post, I added to my phenakistoscope
    sketch. Sketch is <a href="./code/index.html"> here! </a>

    <br><br>

    <b> p5: </b> Main addition was adding rotation guides for assembling the animation, also changed 
    cleaned up the design a bit. 

    <br><br>

    <b> making: </b> Not much to the laser cutting, I'd like to try doing this on the Cameo, too. 
    Taking the photographs took a bit but was meditative. 18 frames was definitely longer than yesterday's
    8, but taking more frames than required is nice, becuase you can always take frames out. 
    I used the Jubilee again for photos; could be fun to make a rotating bed plate :) When saving out
    files, a reminder to pad the filenames with 0s for assembling the images into a gif.

    <h3>reflections & notes</h3>
    Adding a low-budget simulation of the motion in p5 could be fun to add, to give a better
    sense before committing to fabrication + assembly. It'd also be fun to mess around with the 
    foreground/background colors of the paper. I'm already thinking about version control for 
    this sort of creative coding + fabrication; the parameters I'm changing have real-world
    consequence, so what I really want to do is 'comment' the code with a picture of material output 
    rather than a textual transcription. Something to think about...
