    <h3 id="ideation"> ideation </h3>
    For the final project, we need to integrate the various things we've learned this quarter:
    pcbs, serial communication, sensors, mechanisms... all the good stuff. In our in-class brainstorming excercise,
    I sketched out an idea for a puppet with stepper motors controlling each joint. Nadya showed me that 
    Jennifer Jacobs made such a 
    <a href="https://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.11/people/jennifer.jacobs/finalprojectcomplete.html">shadow puppet</a>
    exactly 10 years ago- and it's really cool! I used this as a starting reference. Nadya proposed the puppet could be driven by pose input, 
    and I thought it'd be funny to have the puppet controlled by strings, i.e. a marionette.

    </div>
    <br><br>

    Controlling an entire puppet is perhaps out of scope for a one week project - or at least
    a stretch goal. To break this project up, I 
    thought I could break each joint into a module consisting of a logic + control board driving a stepper motor.
    To start, then, I made just an arm. Now that I've run through the process once, building another arm or leg should
    be much quicker in the future.
    <br><br>
    Some materials planning of things needed:
    <ul>
        <li>NEMA 17 stepper motors (1 per joint)</li>
        <li>delrin, to laser cut marionette appendages</li>
        <li>thread, to connect motor to joint</li>
        <li>pulley, to un/roll thread (1 per stepper motor)</li>
        <li>some sort of 3D printed fixture</li>
        <li>A4988 stepper motor drivers (1 per motor) </li>
        <li>surface mount components (resistors, capacitors, tiny44, ++) </li>
        <li>jellybean parts</li>
    </ul>
    We had basically all of this in lab already! The only thing I ordered was more A4988s.

    <h3 id="circuit"> circuit design & fabrication </h3>
    The board combines my circuits from the last couple of weeks. In 'comms' week we used a 20Mhz crystal and FT232
    serial connection to send messages the the tiny44. I controlled a stepper motor using the A4988 driver 
    in 'drive train' week. Putting these together, my board powers the tiny44 over USB power with 2 pins used 
    to control the stepper motor, and 12V power for the motor. I learned from my past mistakes and added a 100nF
    filter capacitor across motor power to avoid fire. I use a double-sided pcb to make the bottom side the ground plane.

    Milling the bottom side of the boards took a few tries: I think the OtherMill should have a alignment
    bracket to be able to reliably flip the board over, but I couldn't find it at The Mill (I should look around in
    lab for one, too). I upped my trace clearance to be 2mm: it's a few more minutes of milling time, but 
    will save quite a bit of time upstream to help avoid making mistakes while I'm trying to move quickly.
    The vias refused to connect at first, but after throwing enough solder at the problem everything was working.
    I milled & stuffed 2 boards to start.

    <h3 id="firmware"> firmware </h3>
    The microcontroller needs to recieve a message over serial which sets the stepper position. Eventually,
    this will be a joint angle that is mapped to a vertical displacement. The code below
    recieves an absolute position and then moves relative to its current position. The motors I'm using have 200 
    steps/revolution, so sending 200 will make one full rotation, then sending 300 will make another half turn, etc.

    </div>
    <br/><br/>

    Importantly there's no e.g. limit switch to establish where the stepper is at 0. My plan is to manually 
    turn the steppers until the string is fully extended prior to turning the system on. Another takeaway from
    this initial test is how long it takes a stepper to move (relative to how quickly we can move our arms). Decreasing pulse
    width will increase rpm, but a 500Âµs delay was the shortest that the motor would accept.
    I should expect a sort of stop-motion effect from the eventual puppet. To set the fuse bits to use the 20Mhz clock, I used the command:
    <code>avrdude -p t44 -P usb -c avrisp2 -U lfuse:w:0x5E:m</code>

    <h3 id="fixture"> fixturing the arm </h3>
    I laser cut the arms out of Delrin. It seemed reasonable for the whole arm be about 200mm long- that would make the height 
    of a complete puppet ~500 mm or so. I originally had grand ideas of using the ShopBot to make 
    a stage which will house all the electronics inside. I want to focus more on the arm though - an enclosure is of course an 
    important part of the system, but less of an immediate priority for me for the project. Instead of elevating the puppet
    above the table, I figured I could make my life easier and hang it below. I already had a 
    NEMA 17 bracket from a couple weeks ago - I made a horizontal bar
    which spaces out the motors at the correct distance for the size of my arms. To mount the bracket to the 
    horizontal bar I used heat set inserts. Joshua has <a href="https://hackaday.com/2019/02/28/threading-3d-printed-parts-how-to-use-heat-set-inserts/">
    a great guide</a> for threaded 3D printed parts that I used as a resource. The shoulder joint isn't actuated, so it will attach to the post on the
    side.

  I got the model for a pulley from McMaster Carr to fit the 5mm shaft of my steppers. Then I tied thread to the
  pulleys and to the arms. I took... quite a while for me to learn how to tie a slipknot and get the lengths right
  to make sure the arm would have a full range of motion, but I got there in the end. Here is the
  arm's first wave hello; I ended up remaking the arms with smaller holes, and retying everything together tidier.

  <h3 id="pose"> pose estimation </h3>
  After installing a couple of different pose estimation repos which used out-of-date packages, I 
  realized that p5 has a ml5.js project with off-the-shelf pose estimation. If I use that, I can use 
  WebSerial to connect to my boards- hooray! Pose estimation is basically 
  a quite noisy sensor. It gives (x, y) joint positions for each keypoint (left & right shoulder, elbow, wrist, etc). 
  The example didn't distinguish left from right well at all; so to compensate, I only read in joints detected
  on one half of the screen.
  <br><br>
  To translate these screen positions to stepper motor instructions, the code finds relative angles of the joints.
  First we find the shoulder and create a reference vector pointing straight down. We can then define a vector pointing from
  the shoulder to the elbow, and from the elbow to the wrist, and find the angle between each of these and the reference vector.
  I found that an absolute step value of 650 (i.e. 3.25 revolutions) for the elbow joint stepper brings the arm to 90 degrees, 
  so I use that to translate from  angle to step. The wrist joint needs to be additionally offset by the angle of the elow joint. I added some other bits
  and bobs to smooth things out a bit; for example, I only move the steppers if the change in value is greater than
  a tuned tolerance amount. The sketch is <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/b1air/sketches/1vrRdUo-I">here</a>.

  <h3 id="demo">putting it all together</h3>
  A healthy dose of drama when putting everything together. While testing, I found that the steppers
  vibrate and cause the whole fixture to move. I thought the stepper motors were heavy enough 
  to keep it in place but it... danced right off the table. Surprisingly enough, 
  everything stayed in tact. I started clamping the fixture to the table after that. On Wednesday, my plan was to make some sort of 
  'stage', or something to hide the wires. But I ended up frying my boards :) so instead I milled & soldered two new ones.
  If nothing else, getting a couple of new boards milled & stuffed on a quick turnaround was a nice testament
  to this class.

  After a while, the slipknots on the pulleys loosened, probably from some of the arm's jerkier
  motions. This stopped the thread from properly raveling. I added tape as a quick fix, but a
  pulley that better secures the thread would definitely help. A demo video is below. You can see it gets confused sometimes, but generally 
  tries its best to follow my arm. The pose estimation runs at 60 fps but I set the frame rate
  to 5 fps to limit the rate of messages.

  <h3 id="reflection">reflections</h3>
  System integration is hard! System integration on a timeline is even harder! All the individual parts of
  this project are pretty straightforward, but Strange Things happen when you put them together. A lot of the
  time spent/mental stress of this project was making sure my boards would work. Assuming that everything lasts through
  the final presentation demo, I'll feel a lot more confident about this going forward. And being able to trust my
  pcb skills makes space for other important things, like making pretty enclosures!
