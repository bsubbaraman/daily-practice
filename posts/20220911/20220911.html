    Moving away from the spirals, I played around with concentric circles today. Sketch is 
    <a href="./code/concentric-circles/index.html">here</a>.


    <h3>reflections & notes</h3>
    It'll be fun to play around with making different components move clockwise/counter-clockwise by
    changing the ratio between number of frames and spacing around the circle. Another thing
    I've been missing, compared to creative coding in a purely digital context, is color. Two thoughts on
    integrating color into the design: if I stack two (or more) pieces of paper in the laser cutter, can I change the
    material settings to cut through a certain number of layers? Seems like a fire risk and finicky to figure out, 
    but maybe also cool. Alternatively, some designs might permit cutting colored paper to place underneath when photographing; I can also imagine something like a PCB trace router
    to design additional pieces to cut for the back side of the phenakistoscope. Something to mess around with thi week
